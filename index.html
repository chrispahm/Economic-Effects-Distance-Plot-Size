      <h1>Size matters, but distance does too</h1>
      <p>
 In our study, we compare the economic performance of conventional and organic farming, considering differentiated effects of plot sizes and farm-field distances. We analyze an arable,
 a pig fattening, and a dairy farm  as case studies in the same region in Germany which all recently converted to organic farming.  Precise information on the two farm programs before and after conversion are applied to simulate
 the economic performance under varying plot sizes and farm-field distances at identical farm endowments and location factors.

 By <b>clicking on a picture</b> (showing the different farm types in the analysis), you can explore the farms profit, crop production costs and total labour requirements as a function of the farm-field distance and plot size.
